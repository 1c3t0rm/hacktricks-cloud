# GCP - Post Exploitation

## Introduction

After successfully exploiting a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment, it is important to perform post-exploitation activities to maintain access, gather information, and escalate privileges. This section provides an overview of various post-exploitation techniques that can be used in GCP environments.

## Maintaining Access

Once access has been gained to a GCP environment, it is crucial to maintain that access for as long as possible. This can be achieved by creating backdoors, establishing remote access channels, or creating additional user accounts with elevated privileges.

## Information Gathering

Gathering information about the target GCP environment is essential for further exploitation. This can include identifying other resources, services, and accounts within the environment, as well as collecting sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and configuration files.

## Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation is the process of obtaining higher levels of access within a GCP environment. This can involve exploiting misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or weak access controls to gain administrative privileges or access to sensitive data.

## Persistence

Persistence involves maintaining access to a compromised GCP environment even after a system reboot or other disruptions. This can be achieved by creating persistent backdoors, modifying startup scripts, or leveraging scheduled tasks to regain access.

## Covering Tracks

Covering tracks is the process of removing or obfuscating evidence of an attacker's presence within a GCP environment. This can include deleting logs, modifying timestamps, and removing any traces of malicious activity to avoid detection.

## Conclusion

Post-exploitation activities are crucial for maximizing the impact of a successful GCP compromise. By maintaining access, gathering information, escalating privileges, establishing persistence, and covering tracks, an attacker can maintain control over the environment and continue their malicious activities undetected.
