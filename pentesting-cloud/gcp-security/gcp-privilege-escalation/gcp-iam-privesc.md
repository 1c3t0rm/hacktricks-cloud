## IAM

Find more information about IAM in:

{% content-ref url="../gcp-services/gcp-iam-and-org-policies-enum.md" %}
[gcp-iam-and-org-policies-enum.md](../gcp-services/gcp-iam-and-org-policies-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### `iam.roles.update` (`iam.roles.get`)

An attacker with the mentioned permissions will be able to update a role assigned to you and give you extra permissions to other resources like:

### Klingon Translation:

### `iam.roles.update` (`iam.roles.get`)

An attacker with the mentioned permissions will be able to update a role assigned to you and give you extra permissions to other resources like:
```bash
gcloud iam roles update <rol name> --project <project> --add-permissions <permission>
```
**`iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken` (`iam.serviceAccounts.get`)**

An attacker with the mentioned permissions will be able to **request an access token that belongs to a Service Account**, so it's possible to request an access token of a Service Account with more privileges than ours.

You can find a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/4-iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken.sh) and a python script to abuse this privilege [**here**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken.py). For more information check the [**original research**](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/gcp/privilege-escalation-google-cloud-platform-part-1/).

**`iam.serviceAccountKeys.create`**

An attacker with the mentioned permissions will be able to **create a user-managed key for a Service Account**, which will allow us to access GCP as that Service Account.
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account <name> /tmp/key.json

gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=sa_cred.json
```
You can find a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/3-iam.serviceAccountKeys.create.sh) and a python script to abuse this privilege [**here**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/iam.serviceAccountKeys.create.py). For more information check the [**original research**](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/gcp/privilege-escalation-google-cloud-platform-part-1/).

Note that **`iam.serviceAccountKeys.update` won't work to modify the key** of a SA because to do that the permissions `iam.serviceAccountKeys.create` is also needed.

### `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation`

If you have the **`iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation`** permission on a Service Account that has the **`iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken`** permission on a third Service Account, then you can use implicitDelegation to **create a token for that third Service Account**. Here is a diagram to help explain.

![](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image2-500x493.png)

You can find a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/5-iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation.sh) and a python script to abuse this privilege [**here**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation.py). For more information check the [**original research**](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/gcp/privilege-escalation-google-cloud-platform-part-1/).

Note that according to the [**documentation**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts), the delegation only works to generate a token using the [**generateAccessToken()**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/credentials/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/generateAccessToken) method.

### `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob`

An attacker with the mentioned permissions will be able to **sign of arbitrary payloads in GCP**. So it'll be possible to **create an unsigned JWT of the SA and then send it as a blob to get the JWT signed** by the SA we are targeting. For more information [**read this**](https://medium.com/google-cloud/using-serviceaccountactor-iam-role-for-account-impersonation-on-google-cloud-platform-a9e7118480ed).

You can find a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/6-iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob.sh) and a python script to abuse this privilege [**here**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob-accessToken.py) and [**here**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob-gcsSignedUrl.py). For more information check the [**original research**](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/gcp/privilege-escalation-google-cloud-platform-part-1/).

### `iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt`

An attacker with the mentioned permissions will be able to **sign well-formed JSON web tokens (JWTs)**. The difference with the previous method is that **instead of making google sign a blob containing a JWT, we use the signJWT method that already expects a JWT**. This makes it easier to use but you can only sign JWT instead of any bytes.

You can find a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/7-iam.serviceAccounts.signJWT.sh) and a python script to abuse this privilege [**here**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/iam.serviceAccounts.signJWT.py). For more information check the [**original research**](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/gcp/privilege-escalation-google-cloud-platform-part-1/).

### `iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy` <a href="#iam.serviceaccounts.setiampolicy" id="iam.serviceaccounts.setiampolicy"></a>

An attacker with the mentioned permissions will be able to **add IAM policies to service accounts**. You can abuse it to **grant yourself** the permissions you need to impersonate the service account. In the following example we are granting ourselves the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role over the interesting SA:
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${VICTIM_SA}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--member="user:username@domain.com" \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```
**[**ghItlh'a'**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/d-iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy.sh)** **vuln environment** **creation, exploit and cleaning** **automate** **script** **find** **can You.**

### `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`

**iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission** **iam:PassRole permission from AWS** **like** **is**. **essential** **is** **tasks executing** **for** **Engine instance Compute** **initiating** **like** **as** **"actAs"** **to ability** **grants** **it** **as** **Account Service** **a** **secure** **management permission** **and** **access undue gain** **might** **users**. **Additionally**, **actAs.serviceAccounts.iam** **the** **exploiting** **methods various** **involves**, **permissions of set** **a** **requiring** **each** **methods other with contrasting** **one just need** **that**.

#### Service account impersonation <a href="#service-account-impersonation" id="service-account-impersonation"></a>

**useful very** **be can** **account service a impersonating** **to** **privileges better and new** **obtain** **to**. **ways three** **are** **which** **account service another impersonate** **can you** [**here covered**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts#impersonating\_a\_service\_account):

* **keys private RSA using** **Authentication** **(above covered)**
* **policies IAM Cloud using** **Authorization** **(here covered)**
* **services GCP on jobs Deploying** **account user a compromise the of applicable more** **(account user a compromise the of applicable more)**

### `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken`

**permissions mentioned the with** **attacker an** **will be able to** **JWT OpenID generate** **the**. **resource a against authorization implicit any carry necessarily not do** **and** **identity assert to used are** **JWT OpenID** **These**.

# First activate the SA with iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken over the other SA
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=/path/to/svc_account.json
# Then, generate token
gcloud auth print-identity-token "${ATTACK_SA}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --audiences=https://example.com
```
DaH jImej: 

```
ghItlh 'e' vItlhutlh
```

This will allow you to gain unauthorized access to the service.
```bash
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer id_token" https://some-cloud-run-uc.a.run.app
```
Some services that support authentication via this kind of tokens are:

* [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/)
* [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/)
* [Google Identity Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto)
* [Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/authenticating-users-google-id) (if using Google OIDC)

You can find an example on how to create and OpenID token behalf a service account [**here**](https://github.com/carlospolop-forks/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken.py).
