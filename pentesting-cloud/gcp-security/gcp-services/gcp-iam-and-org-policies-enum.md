## Users & Groups

For an intro about how Users & Groups work in GCP check:

{% content-ref url="../gcp-basic-information.md" %}
[gcp-basic-information.md](../gcp-basic-information.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Enumeration

With the permissions **`serviceusage.services.enable`** and **`serviceusage.services.use`** it's possible to **enable services** in a project and use them.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that by default, Workspace users are granted the role **Project Creator**, giving them access to **create new projects**. When a user creates a project, he is granted the **`owner`** role over it. So, he could **enable these services over the project to be able to enumerate Workspace**.

However, notice that it's also needed to have **enough permissions in Workspace** to be able to call these APIs.
{% endhint %}

If you can **enable the `admin` service** and if your user has **enough privileges in workspace,** you could **enumerate all groups & users** with the following lines.\
Even if it says **`identity groups`**, it also returns **users without any groups**:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Enable admin
gcloud services enable admin.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudidentity.googleapis.com

# Using admin.googleapis.com
## List all users
gcloud organizations list #The DIRECTORY_CUSTOMER_ID is the Workspace ID
gcloud beta identity groups preview --customer <workspace-id>

# Using cloudidentity.googleapis.com
## List groups of a user
gcloud identity groups memberships search-transitive-groups --member-email <email> --labels=cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum

## List Group Members
gcloud identity groups memberships list --group-email=<email>
### Make it transitive
gcloud identity groups memberships search-transitive-memberships --group-email=<email>

## Get a graph (if you have enough permissions)
gcloud identity groups memberships get-membership-graph --member-email=<email> --labels=cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="success" %}
In the previous examples the param `--labels` is required, so a generic value is used (it's not requires if you used the API directly like [**PurplePanda does in here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/PurplePanda/blob/master/intel/google/discovery/disc\_groups\_users.py).
{% endhint %}

Even with the admin service enable, it's possible that you get an error enumerating them because your compromised workspace user doesn't have enough permissions:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## IAM

Check [**this for basic information about IAM**](../gcp-basic-information.md#iam-roles).

### Default Permissions

From the [**docs**](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/default-access-control): When an organization resource is created, all users in your domain are granted the **Billing Account Creator** and **Project Creator** roles by default. These default roles allow your users to start using Google Cloud immediately, but are not intended for use in regular operation of your organization resource.

These **roles** grant the **permissions**:

* `billing.accounts.create` and `resourcemanager.organizations.get`
* `resourcemanager.organizations.get` and `resourcemanager.projects.create`

Moreover, when a user creates a project, he is **granted owner of that project automatically** according to the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-proj). Therefore, by default, a user will be able to create a project and run any service on it (miners? Workspace enumeration? ...)

{% hint style="danger" %}
The highest privilege in a GCP Organization is the **Organization Administrator** role.
{% endhint %}

### set-iam-policy vs add-iam-policy-binding

In most of the services you will be able to change the permissions over a resource using the method **`add-iam-policy-binding`** or **`set-iam-policy`**. The main difference is that **`add-iam-policy-binding` adds a new role binding** to the existent IAM policy while **`set-iam-policy`** will **delete the previously** granted permissions and **set only the ones** indicated in the command.

### Enumeration
```bash
# Roles
## List roles
gcloud iam roles list --project $PROJECT_ID # List only custom roles
gcloud iam roles list --filter='etag:AA=='

## Get perms and description of role
gcloud iam roles describe roles/container.admin
gcloud iam roles describe --project <proj-name> <role-name>

# Policies
gcloud organizations get-iam-policy <org_id>
gcloud resource-manager folders get-iam-policy <folder-id>
gcloud projects get-iam-policy <project-id>

# MISC
## Testable permissions in resource
gcloud iam list-testable-permissions --filter "NOT apiDisabled: true" <resource>
## Grantable roles to a resource
gcloud iam list-grantable-roles <project URL>
```
#### Enumeration via cloudasset

There are different ways to check all the permissions of a user in different resources (such as organizations, folders, projects...) using this service.

* The permission **`cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies`** can request **all the iam policies** inside a resource.

#### Enumeration via cloudasset

There are different ways to check all the permissions of a user in different resources (such as organizations, folders, projects...) using this service.

* The permission **`cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies`** can request **all the iam policies** inside a resource.
```bash
gcloud asset search-all-iam-policies #By default uses current configured project
gcloud asset search-all-iam-policies --scope folders/1234567
gcloud asset search-all-iam-policies --scope organizations/123456
gcloud asset search-all-iam-policies --scope projects/project-id-123123
```
* **`cloudasset.assets.analyzeIamPolicy`** **permission** can **request** **all the iam policies** of a **principal** inside a **resource**.

* **`cloudasset.assets.analyzeIamPolicy`** **permission** can **request** **all the iam policies** of a **principal** inside a **resource**.
```bash
# Needs perm "cloudasset.assets.analyzeIamPolicy" over the asset
gcloud asset analyze-iam-policy --organization=<org-id> \
--identity='user:email@hacktricks.xyz'
gcloud asset analyze-iam-policy --folder=<folder-id> \
--identity='user:email@hacktricks.xyz'
gcloud asset analyze-iam-policy --project=<project-name> \
--identity='user:email@hacktricks.xyz'
```
* **`cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources`** jatlhbe'chugh, ghap, qorwagh, pagh organization resources list. IAM related resources (like roles) included.
```bash
gcloud asset search-all-resources --scope projects/<proj-name>
gcloud asset search-all-resources --scope folders/1234567
gcloud asset search-all-resources --scope organizations/123456
```
* **`cloudasset.assets.analyzeMove`** permission may be useful to retrieve policies affecting a resource like a project.
```bash
gcloud asset analyze-move --project=<proj-name> \
--destination-organization=609216679593
```
* **`cloudasset.assets.queryIamPolicy`** permission could also provide access to discover permissions of principals.
