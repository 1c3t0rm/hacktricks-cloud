# GCP - Qa'Hom

## Introduction

In this section, we will explore various techniques for achieving persistence in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments. Persistence refers to the ability to maintain access to a compromised system even after a reboot or other system changes. By establishing persistence, an attacker can ensure continued access to the target environment and carry out malicious activities over an extended period of time.
