## Lambda Extensions

Lambda extensions enhance functions by integrating with various **monitoring, observability, security, and governance tools**. These extensions, added via [.zip archives using Lambda layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) or included in [container image deployments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/working-with-lambda-layers-and-extensions-in-container-images/), operate in two modes: **internal** and **external**.

* **Internal extensions** merge with the runtime process, manipulating its startup using **language-specific environment variables** and **wrapper scripts**. This customization applies to a range of runtimes, including **Java Correto 8 and 11, Node.js 10 and 12, and .NET Core 3.1**.

* **External extensions** run as separate processes, maintaining operation alignment with the Lambda function's lifecycle. They're compatible with various runtimes like **Node.js 10 and 12, Python 3.7 and 3.8, Ruby 2.5 and 2.7, Java Corretto 8 and 11, .NET Core 3.1**, and **custom runtimes**.


For more information about [**how lambda extensions work check the docs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html).

### External Extension for Persistence, Stealing Requests & modifying Requests

**This is going to be a summary for the technique proposed in this post:** [**https://www.clearvector.com/blog/lambda-spy/**](https://www.clearvector.com/blog/lambda-spy/)

The researchers found that the default Linux kernel in the Lambda runtime environment is compiled with ‚Äú**process\_vm\_readv**‚Äù and ‚Äú**process\_vm\_writev**‚Äù system calls. And all processes run with the same user ID, even the new process created for the external extension. **This means that an external extension has full read and write access to Rapid‚Äôs heap memory, by design.**

Moreover, Lambda **extensions** can **subscribe** to **invocation events**; however, AWS does not expose the raw data to the extension. So the extension won't be able to gather sensitive information sent in the HTTP request.

The **Init** (Rapid) process listens for all API requests on **http://127.0.0.1:9001**. Lambda **extensions** are loaded and **executed** before any runtime code, but **after Rapid**.

The **variable** named ‚Äú**AWS\_LAMBDA\_RUNTIME\_API**‚Äù **informs** the child **runtime** processes and other extensions of the **IP and port number of the Rapid API**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Overwriting** this environment variable with a **port number that we control** will allow us to **man-in-the-middle all activity** within the Lambda runtime.\
And because the kernel is compiled with those system calls and the **extension** is **running** with the **same user ID** as the Rapid Init, it's possible to **overwrite** the process **memory** and **change the port**.
{% endhint %}

Since **extensions execute before any runtime code**, the **updated environment variable will take effect when the runtime process is executed** (Python, Java, Node, Ruby, etc). In addition, any extensions that are loaded after ours, and use this variable, will be proxied through our extension as well. This could allow malware to **completely disable security products or logging extensions from within the runtime itself**.

The tool [**lambda-spy**](https://github.com/clearvector/lambda-spy) was created to perform that **memory write** and **steal sensitive information** from lambda requests, other **extensions** **requests** and even **modify them**.
