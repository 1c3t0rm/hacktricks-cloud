# AWS - Post Exploitation

## Introduction

After successfully compromising an AWS environment, the next step is to perform post-exploitation activities. This phase involves exploring the compromised system, escalating privileges, and maintaining access to the environment. In this section, we will cover various post-exploitation techniques and tools that can be used in an AWS environment.

## Enumeration

During the post-exploitation phase, it is crucial to gather as much information as possible about the compromised system and the AWS environment. This information can help in identifying potential targets for privilege escalation and data exfiltration. Some common enumeration techniques include:

- **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) can be used to gather information about the AWS environment, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM roles, etc.

- **AWS SDKs**: Software Development Kits (SDKs) provided by AWS can be used to programmatically interact with the AWS environment and gather information.

- **Metadata Service**: The AWS metadata service provides information about the EC2 instance, such as instance ID, IAM role, security groups, etc. This information can be accessed from within the compromised system.

- **Port Scanning**: Conducting port scans can help identify open ports and services running on the compromised system. Tools like Nmap can be used for this purpose.

## Privilege Escalation

Once initial access is gained, the next objective is to escalate privileges and gain higher levels of access within the AWS environment. Some common privilege escalation techniques include:

- **Misconfigured IAM Roles**: Misconfigured IAM roles can provide excessive permissions to an attacker. By identifying and exploiting these misconfigurations, an attacker can gain administrative access to the AWS environment.

- **Exploiting EC2 Instance Metadata**: The EC2 instance metadata service can be exploited to retrieve sensitive information, such as temporary security credentials or user data, which can be used for privilege escalation.

- **Exploiting Misconfigured S3 Buckets**: Misconfigured S3 buckets can provide unauthorized access to sensitive data. By exploiting these misconfigurations, an attacker can gain access to sensitive information and potentially escalate privileges.

## Persistence

Maintaining access to the compromised system is crucial for a successful post-exploitation phase. Some common persistence techniques in an AWS environment include:

- **Backdooring EC2 Instances**: By adding a backdoor to an EC2 instance, an attacker can maintain access even if the initial compromise is detected and remediated.

- **Creating IAM Users/Roles**: Creating new IAM users or roles with excessive permissions can provide long-term access to the AWS environment.

- **Scheduled Tasks**: Creating scheduled tasks or cron jobs can ensure that the attacker's code or backdoor is executed periodically, maintaining access to the compromised system.

## Data Exfiltration

Once access is gained and maintained, the next objective is to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised system. Some common data exfiltration techniques in an AWS environment include:

- **S3 Bucket Exfiltration**: If the compromised system has access to S3 buckets, an attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data by copying it to their own controlled S3 bucket.

- **Database Exfiltration**: If the compromised system has access to databases, an attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data by querying the database and exporting the results.

- **API Exfiltration**: If the compromised system has access to APIs, an attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data by making API calls to extract the desired information.

## Covering Tracks

To avoid detection and maintain persistence, it is important to cover tracks and remove any evidence of the attacker's presence. Some common techniques to cover tracks in an AWS environment include:

- **Deleting Logs**: Deleting logs can help remove evidence of the attacker's activities. This can be done by deleting log files or modifying log entries.

- **Modifying CloudTrail**: CloudTrail logs can provide valuable information about the attacker's activities. Modifying or disabling CloudTrail can help cover tracks and hinder forensic investigations.

- **Removing Backdoors**: If backdoors were added during the initial compromise, it is important to remove them to avoid detection and maintain persistence.

- **Cleaning Artifacts**: Cleaning up any artifacts left behind by the attacker, such as temporary files or scripts, can help cover tracks and remove evidence of the compromise.

Remember, post-exploitation activities should be performed carefully and with caution to avoid detection and minimize the impact on the compromised system and the AWS environment.
